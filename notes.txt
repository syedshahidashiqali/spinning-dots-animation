> We want to remove the margin on every fourth grid module

HTML:

<section class="grid">
  <article class="module">One</article>
  <article class="module">Two</article>
  <article class="module">Three</article>
  <article class="module">Four</article>
  <article class="module">Five</article>
</section>

CSS:

.module:nth-child(4n) {
  margin-right: 0;
}

an+b

a > integer value
n > literal letter
+ , - > addition operator and can also be "-"
b > integer, required only if the operator is included in the formula

This formula is an equation.

> "n" if included, represents a set of increasing positive integers
  (just like iterating through an array)
==============
p {
  transfrom: translate(x, y) // moves an elem in x or y direction (up or down)
  transfrom: scale(x, y) // grow size of an element. This also applies to the font-size, padding, 
                            height, and width of an element, too.
}

direction: alternate  // means The animation is played forwards first, then backwards

easing: ease-in-out // That is, the change happens slowly both at the beginning and end, 
                       and speeds up only in the middle somewhere. This gives soft edges 
                       (metaphorically) to the change and generally feels good.

ease-in  // slow at the beginning, fast/abrupt at the end
ease-out // fast/abrupt at the beginning, slow at the end

elem.animate(frames, timing)
frames = []
timing= {}
